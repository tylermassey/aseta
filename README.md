# aseta

## Disclaimer: aseta is in active development and is changing rapidly

aseta is an app for tracking expenses.

### 🤔 Why

After becoming jaded from other tracking and budgeting apps that weren't easy to use, I wanted to make my own.

### 🏆 Goal

My goal is not to take over the expense tracking and budgeting space. I'm building what will work best for me--but in a scalable way so that others can see if it works for them as well.
